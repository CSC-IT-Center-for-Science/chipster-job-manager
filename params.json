{"name":"Chipster Job Manager","tagline":"Job execution manager for Chipster","body":"===================\r\nChipster JobManager\r\n===================\r\n\r\nChipster JobManager provides capabilities to move the Chipster job management\r\nresponsibility away from clients to remote Chipster JobManager service. When\r\nJobManager is in use, the Chipster clients can start a job execution, save the\r\nsession state locally and disconnect. Job is then executed on Chipster analysis\r\nservers and managed by the JobManager, which saves the results upon completion\r\nand reschedules the job in case the execution fails.\r\n\r\nTo use JobManager with Chipster the message routing configuration must be\r\nchanged so that JobManager sits in between the client and analysis servers. \r\n\r\nThe JobManager uses Stomp, so following entry must be added to\r\n``transportConnectors`` section in ``chipster/activemq/conf/activemq.xml``:\r\n\r\n    ``<transportConnector name=\"stomp\" uri=\"stomp://<server_ip>:61613\"/>``\r\n\r\nThe port number 61613 is the default for stomp protocol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Chipster refer to:\r\n\r\n    http://chipster.csc.fi/\r\n\r\n\r\n==========\r\nDeveloping\r\n==========\r\n\r\nRun tests (requires tox)\r\n    ``tox .``\r\n\r\nRun coverage for tests (requires nose, pytest, coverage)\r\n    ``nosetests --cover-package=jobmanager --with-coverage``\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
