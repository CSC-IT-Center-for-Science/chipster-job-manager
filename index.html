<p>Chipster JobManager provides capabilities to move the Chipster job management
responsibility away from clients to remote Chipster JobManager service. When
JobManager is in use, the Chipster clients can start a job execution, save the
session state locally and disconnect. Job is then executed on Chipster analysis
servers and managed by the JobManager, which saves the results upon completion
and reschedules the job in case the execution fails.</p>

<p>To use JobManager with Chipster the message routing configuration must be
changed so that JobManager sits in between the client and analysis servers. </p>

<p>The JobManager uses Stomp, so following entry must be added to
<code>transportConnectors</code> section in <code>chipster/activemq/conf/activemq.xml</code>:</p>

<p>
<code>
&lt;transportConnector name="stomp" uri="stomp://&lt;server_ip&gt;:61613"/&gt;
</code>
</p>

<p>The port number 61613 is the default for stomp protocol. Currently Stomp+SSL transport <a href="https://github.com/nikipore/stompest/issues/3">is not supported</a>.</p>

JobManager manages Job objects, which each represent one job/task submitted by an user to Chipster platform.
JobManager receives authenticated requests from Chipster's authenticator component. Job submissions, state handling and results are communicated with the computing component of the Chipster platform.
Finally the outcome of the computation is reported directly to user's client software.

<h3>Job State</h3>
<a name="states">
<img src="img/task_states.png" alt="Job Manager task states, img/task_states.dot for textual representation"/>
</a>

<h3>Job Queueing</h3>
<a name="queueing"></a>
If a received job is acked by a computing component telling the it is currently busy the job will be queued. This way the job will not timeout, and the job resubmission will be tried once 
<ul>
<li>the job timer triggers: JobManager uses internal polling loop which goes through all active jobs (i.e. jobs which are not cancelled, completed, failed, or errored) and checks
    if job resubmission should be tried.
<li>When a running job completes, JobManager dequeues another job to execution. This prevents the need to wait for timer to trigger. Dequeued job might not be to proceed to execution in case the tool it requires is not available on the available host.
Dequeued field of the job is updated everytime a job is queued, and the job with latest dequeued timestamp is dequeued.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>Run tests (requires tox)
    <code>tox .</code></p>

<p>Run coverage for tests (requires nose, pytest, coverage)
    <code>nosetests --cover-package=jobmanager --with-coverage</code></p>
